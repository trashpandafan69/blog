This will be a long rant cause I want to record all the injustice and frustration I have experienced and witnessed as an immigrant who is currently living in Canada on a temporary resident status, which contributes significantly to my depression and anxiety in the past 2 years. Noted that I do not experience all these issues firsthand but have witnessed some that happen to other immigrants, and I feel like we don’t talk about them enough.

1. Being blamed for fucking everything bad that is happening to Canada right now — healthcare, living expenses, education, infrastructure — even though you are suffering in the same condition and even face more systematic discrimination than the average Canadian citizen

2. Being asked to “assimilate to Canadian culture” — what is Canadian culture in the first place? Canadians themselves haven’t figured it out yet as well

3. The bureaucracy of immigration paperwork that doesn't care how hard you work, and will reject you in a heartbeat due to the slightest misinformation that is not intended

4. The power imbalance between you, IRCC\* and your employer — you cannot “have a gap year to focus on your mental health”, “quit this job and leave your abusive employers” as your Canadian peers do because you will lose your resident status

5. If you are on a closed work permit\*, being taken advantage of by greedy employers that pay you minimum wage for the toughest job no Canadians want to do, since you are scared of losing your status — this is literally modern slavery

6. If you are visibly non-white — the subtle but consistent passive aggressiveness you have experienced in real life

7. If you are South Asian — the absolutely disgusting racist things Canadian people say about your people online, and the racism discrimination you have experienced in your workplace and day-to-day life

8. The financial instability living in such an expensive country — nobody voluntarily chooses to work at Tim Horton while living with 5 roommates in a 2-bedroom apartment

9. The feeling of “everything is temporary” — no matter it is your resident status, your job, your apartment, your material possessions, your relationships, your pets, you are afraid of establishing anything permanent since you might be asked to get out of this country anytime and everything will be taken away from you

10. Being gaslighted by both IRCC and other immigrants to think that “nobody deserves a PR\*” — but you do deserve to be treated as a human being with basic decency, as any other person living in this country

11. Paying 3 times of the tuition fee, and being gaslighted to think that it’s reasonable because “you do not pay taxes to the Canadian government before coming here" — which is absolute bullshit because you do not receive the benefit of paying tax before coming here as well

12. 0 power in voting and participating in politics — being “promised” by IRCC to have some type of insurance to PR, no matter it’s a direct PR pathway or indirect false advertisement, but they can revoke it anytime and you can do nothing about it — you basically live in a “democratic” state but are ruled by the government authoritatively

13. The cultural and language barriers you face on a daily basis but being seen as incompetent at your school or workplace because you don’t small talk and understand the social cues as Canadians do, which are obviously “more superior” than the culture you are brought up with

14. If you don’t have a safety net in your original country as well — the feeling that you have no place to stay in this world and you are not welcomed anywhere

The voices of immigrants in Canada are so small yet deserve to be heard. But every time an immigrant tries to bring it up, whether it is on a national public broadcaster like CBC or social media like Instagram, it just gives some Canadians another opportunity to be racist and complain about "too many Indians". Canadians think it’s a zero-sum game and immigrants are taking advantage of them, but in reality nobody is the winner in the system, immigrants have been exploited by both the government and the employers, and have been the scapegoat for every problem in this country in the past 5 years.

To clarify, I have nothing against Canadian people; in contrast, I have met some of the most amazing people in this country, and it is one of the main reasons why I am so desperate to continue staying here and call it my home. However, how the government treats the immigrants and how the media portraits immigrants are extremely disappointing to see, and seems like Canadian people care about the immigration problem, but not the immigrants themselves.
