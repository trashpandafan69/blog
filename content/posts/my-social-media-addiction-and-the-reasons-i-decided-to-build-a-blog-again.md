I like reading posts online and web development, and personal blog combines the best of the both worlds. I have tried to build a personal blog in the past, but I didn't stick to them in the end. I either got too busy with life or just lose passion. This year I started going to therapy, and journaling is a good way for me to put my abstract chaotic thoughts into something more concrete. As a result, I want to treat blogging as a therapy method, a log for random thoughts, or a one-sided communication to the internet. I would love to share my knowledge on some specific topics too, if anyone finds it helpful.

## Why am I not satisfied with the existing social media platforms

I have used a lot of social media platforms which allows me to do kind of journaling/logging/knowledge sharing, but none of them really meet my needs.

From 2012 to 2021, during the time I was still living in China, I was continuously using a Chinese website called [douban](http://douban.com/). Imagine it as a combination of letterboxd, rateyourmusic, goodreads, reddit, twitter, and blogging... It has attracted a lot of young Chinese Internet users to use it, lots of them are into art.

I would log the media I consumed recently on my account, sometimes left a rating too. I also liked to journaling using its "broadcast" feature on my homepage. It has a following mechanism so you can see the "tweets" from other users you've followed as well. I stopped using it because I also liked posting and reposting a lot about political comments on my account, and my "tweets" constantly got deleted and my account got banned multiple times. For the sake of my safety and sanity, I left and migrated to Mastodon.

Mastodon is a decentralized social networking that is similar to Twitter. What makes it different from social media like Twitter is that everyone can create an instance and set up their own rules, while each instance can talk to each others as well. Different instances attract different group of people with similar interests and political views. Mastodon only provides the tool to build the social media platform, while the kind of users you attracts on your instance is totally up to you. Since Mastodon requires users to have a basic understanding of how decentralized social networking works, and most of the Internet users don't bothered to spend 2 minutes to read the description to understand it, most Mastodon users are nerds who advocate for the philosophy of an open, free, and transparent social network where there is not an authoritarian roles that controls the rules, user's data, etc.

I chose to make my account on [cmx.im](cmx.im), the biggest Chinese Mastodon instance. A lot of the users there are like me who are tired of censorship on Chinese social media like douban and weibo. I quite like it and have used it as my main social media account since 2021. It is really a fresh of air to be able to speak Chinese freely without the fear of censorship from the authority. However, you are not 100% safe if you are using it from China. Some users have reported that they got caught by their local police due to some of their posts on Mastodon, and they believed the police has used some social engineering techniques to find out who they are in real life from their Mastodon account. the domain is also banned by GFW, so if you are trying to visit it using VPN, your ISP is able to detect it, and the local police are able to trace it back to your identity and arrest you if they want.

I have the privilege to live aboard in a western country and continue using it after leaving China. I like the freedom it provides, but I am not a huge fan a microblogging. I find it hard to limit my thoughts in 500 words. I like writing in paragraphs and using markdowns to add titles, highlights, etc. I also dislike how echo chambered the major Chinese community is. A lot of the users take a moral high ground and police or even cyber bully others who hold a slightly different value than them. I guess it's just a human nature as social animals, even if we have created a totally decentralized platform without "censorship", people will still find their ways to make up a group and isolate others that are outside of the group.

Of course, I also use social platforms like Discord and Instagram, but neither of them are for blogging. I have seen people using Instagram as their blog, posting a long paragraph as a story, but Instagram makes it very hard to read any kinds of long texts. All it does is to send image or video based slop to attract you from reading any word. Reading Reddit posts for 5 hours might be healthier than scrolling through Instagram reels for 5 minutes, which I suspect might have already caused irreversible brain damage to me. I want to try my best to only use Instagram as a message app to catch up with friends, and stay away from short videos.
